- Git for version control

### Getting Started
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speaker-recognition-system.git
   cd speaker-recognition-system
   ```
3. Create a new branch for your feature:

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### MATLAB Code Style
1. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Variables: `camelCase` (e.g., `trainAccuracy`)
   - Functions: `camelCase` (e.g., `calculateMFCC`)
   - Constants: `UPPER_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_EPOCHS`)

2. **Comments**:
   - Use English for all comments
   - Add function headers with description, inputs, and outputs
   ```matlab
   function accuracy = calculateAccuracy(predictions, labels)
       % Calculate classification accuracy
       % Inputs:
       %   predictions - Predicted class labels
       %   labels - True class labels
       % Output:
       %   accuracy - Classification accuracy (0-1)
   ```

3. **Code Structure**:
   - Maximum line length: 100 characters
   - Use meaningful variable names
   - Add error checking for inputs
   - Include progress indicators for long operations

### Documentation Style
1. Use clear, concise language
2. Include code examples for new features
3. Update both English and Chinese documentation
4. Use consistent formatting with existing docs
